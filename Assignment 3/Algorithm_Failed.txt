Algorithm failed on following Datasets:


---- DATASET 1 ----

Reason: Because some data points of each class are near to other class points hence they are classified wrongly.


---- DATASET 3 ----

Reason: Firstly it contains noise which is difficult to classify in single class by k-mean clustering so it is distributed among different classes, also then we have 
one class extra so one cluster is broken in two parts (we can see in plot) . Secondly, circular type of datasets are difficult to classify because mean value of 
such clusters are close.


---- DATASET 4 ----

Reason: because smile and eyes are close to outside class (circular) hence difficult to classify.


---- DATASET 6 ----

Reason: circular type of datasets are difficult to classify because mean value of such clusters are close.
